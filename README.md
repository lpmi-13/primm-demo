# PRIMM Demo

This is going to be a Proof of Concept to see how much PRIMM we can get into a web app.

PRIMM (Sentance, 2019) is a method of teaching encompassing the following steps:

1) Predict
2) Run
3) Investigate
4) Modify
5) Make

The first two are fairly straightforward, involving learners predicting what the return value of a function will be. After that it gets a little bit trickier, but I want to see how far we can get.

> This currently only does P and R

## Running locally
